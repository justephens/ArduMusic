# ArduMusic
This project aims to use an Arduino Uno to play music. Eventually, it is hoped one would be able to create music in a Software such as [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) and directly upload this to the Arduino via a USB connection.

## Arduino
ArduMusic uses the ToneLibrary by Brett Hagman to play notes. To compile and upload your Arduino code, you need to install this library. There are two ways to do this, the first being the easiest:

1. **Arduino IDE** - Using the built in [Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries#toc3). If you can't find it, try updated your IDE to the current version.
2. **Source** - You can get the source code from the [Google Code Archive](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rogue-code/wikis/ToneLibraryDocumentation.wiki#Ugly_Details).

## Companion Scripts
ArduMusic includes one companion script, which is planned to be used to be used to load .mscx files (Uncompressed MuseScore XML Exports).  ***SCRIPT IN DEVELOPEMENT***.
